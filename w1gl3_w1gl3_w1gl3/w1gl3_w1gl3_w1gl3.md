1. First googled for finding location based on MAC Address. I knew that MAC Address was a unique ID and I should have known that there's no way we can actually pinpoint the location, but at that time it just didn't strike me. 

2. After googling, one of the search results was a website named wigle.net, so hopped into that, created an account and searched for the MAC Address, to only find that the OUI (Organisationally Unique Identifier, which i just learned about then) (first 3 letters), belonged to a company named Visteon Corporation.

3. At first I was puzzled, according to the description, I thought it should have belonged to Mahindra. Then I just googled Visteon Corporation, only to find one of the search results was "Mahindra Marazzo". 

4. Then I found out that Visteon helped in launching Mahindra's cars, guess when, in september 2023.

5. So naturally, then I tried Michigan, then Detroit because Michigan was in Detroit. Then I tried its locations in India cuz that seemed more sensible, after like 5-6 locations, Thiruvananthapuram was the location.
