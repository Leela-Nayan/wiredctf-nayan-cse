# The_Easy_One

1. This was also literally texbook perfect. Because as soon as I saw the image, I knew it had to be steganography, so I searched online for image steg decoders, found one website, uploaded the pic and tried to print its strings, but none of them made any sense.

2. The website had some filters, and I was trying them when I found that the LSB Half filter partially showed the QR Code.

3. Tried searching online for ways to apply LSB to a filter, but didn't find anything. So asked ChatGPT and it gave me a code to run. Ran the code and it gave me an LSB applied image, and the QR Code was visible. (And Yes, I later googled what LSB was as well somehwere along this process.)
