# Int3rc3pt

1. I didn't know what to do, so one anna asked me if I knew what WireShark was, and I did. So I opened it up and opened the pcap file on it and since there weren't many packets, I started going through them. Found the flag on one of them and was excited and tried the flag.

2. Well it was wrong, and I thought maybe it had to do something with not having spaces in tha flag and tried all possible combinations. But then, one anna told me maybe it was encoded. Well the only encryption I knew was base64, so I tried it and it worked.
