1. This level was easy as well. The SSID and password were given, connected to the wi-fi page and anna told me to find the router's page. Opened it and he said the hint lies in the name itself. So I searched for a subpage named lost, and robots, but didn't work. 

2. So I googled for lost in a website, didn't find anything but upon googling robots in a website, found that I had to search for robots.txt

3. Found it, searched for the flag and found it.
