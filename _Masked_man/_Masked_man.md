1. THIS WAS LITERALLY TEXTBOOK PERFECT AND I THOUGHT I CRACKED IT INITIALLY (AND I DID), BUT DUMB ME, couldn't type in a goddamn date properly. Just like 2 days prior to the CTF i read up on the resources mentioned in the Discord Server and one of them was the bi0s wiki page and I explored all parts of it and even the phenomenon of steganography. So as soon as I saw a .wav file, I knew it had to be that.

2. So I quickly converted the .wav file to a spectogram and it gave me a picture of Ryan Reynolds. So the only thing possible was that it was his birthday, which it was, BUT ONLY IF I COULD TYPE THE CORRECT BIRTH DATE. IT WAS ONLY THE NEXT MORNING THAT I REALISED THAT.
