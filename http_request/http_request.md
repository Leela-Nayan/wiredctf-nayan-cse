# http_request

This one was actually easy, but I couldn't do it without the hint. I actually tried this on the first day, but I was able to try it for only 15 minutes and got nowhere. The next day, I didn't try it as far as I remember. Then on the last day, figured I'd give this one a try and started trying. Anna gave me a hint to look for sending commmands to search for strings over the DNS. 

Googled it and found the format for sending a searchQuery. Found the flag.
