# AT

1. This one actually troubled me a lot. I was too focused on what the hint was saying directly and never bothered to look around. 

2. I got parts 1, 2 and 5 on my own but I actually struggled a lot for Parts 3 & 4. Akka gave me some hints and told me to not get focused directly on the hint, and she told my to try disconnecting the current AP for part 4 but that thought would have never occured to me frankly speaking. Only then I got the flag.
