# Magic_Mystery

1. So I actually tried this on the first day, didn't get anywhere. Next day anna told me to view the hex file properly (I was using nano), and read up on magic numbers. 

2. Then, I pieced it together and then edited the hex file and added in the magic numbers. It worked and got the flag.
