This was an easy one, but long and tiring. I had already prior experience with a 16x2 LCD but it was always with an arduino. So I looked up the functions of each of the pins and then found out that the RS and E connections were swapped. Then saw the hint and saw the YT video, but what he said didn't work for me (I still don't know why), googled again and then found out that he didn't mention the initialisation procedure properly. Googled it and then got it.
